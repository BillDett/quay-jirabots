# Quay JiraBots

Some simple automation to keep PROJQUAY in order.

* Backlog Bot - automatically expire old abandoned issues on the backlog
* Legacy Bot - watches for new issues created in QUAY (formerly CoreOS Jira) and adds comment indicating the project is no longer being maintained
* Clair Issue Bot - create a properly labeled PROJQUAY issue for any github issues raised on Clair repo so that we can include in triage.
